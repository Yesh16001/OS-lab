## Introduction  
This report presents the practical assignments completed as part of the **Operating Systems Laboratory** for the academic year **2024–25**. The primary goal of these labs was to gain practical understanding of essential OS concepts such as process management, CPU scheduling, memory handling, file systems, and more.

## Practicals Performed

### 1. **Basic Linux Commands**
- **Objective**: To get familiar with essential Linux shell commands used for navigating and managing the file system.
- **Summary**: Practiced commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and others to manage directories and files.
- **Key Concepts**: Command-line interface, file and directory operations, shell navigation.

### 2. **File Permissions and Redirection**
- **Objective**: To understand and modify file permissions and use redirection operators in the Linux shell.
- **Summary**: Used `chmod` to set file permissions for owner, group, and others. Practiced input/output redirection using `>`, `>>`, `<`, and pipes (`|`).
- **Key Concepts**: File permissions, user groups, input/output redirection, piping.

### 3. **Simple Shell Scripting**
- **Objective**: To write and execute basic shell scripts.
- **Summary**: Developed shell scripts for tasks such as displaying messages, reading user input, performing arithmetic operations, and using loops and variables.
- **Key Concepts**: Script automation, variables, loops, conditional statements.

### 4. **Process Creation (Parent and Child)**
- **Objective**: To demonstrate process creation in an OS using C, highlighting parent-child interactions.
- **Summary**: Developed a C program using `fork()` to create a child process and explored the execution behavior of both parent and child.
- **Key Concepts**: Process creation, `fork()`, `exec()`, inter-process communication.

### 5. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling**
- **Objective**: To implement the FCFS CPU scheduling algorithm.
- **Summary**: Created a C program simulating FCFS, which schedules processes in the sequence of their arrival.
- **Key Concepts**: Scheduling, process queue.

### 6. **Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling**
- **Objective**: To implement the SJF CPU scheduling algorithm.
- **Summary**: Coded a scheduling simulation that prioritizes processes with the shortest burst time.
- **Key Concepts**: Burst time-based scheduling.

### 7. **Priority-Based CPU Scheduling**
- **Objective**: To implement scheduling based on process priority.
- **Summary**: Wrote a C program that selects processes based on their priority value, with lower numbers indicating higher priority.
- **Key Concepts**: Priority scheduling, process management.

### 8. **Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance**
- **Objective**: To simulate deadlock avoidance using Banker's Algorithm.
- **Summary**: Implemented a resource allocation algorithm in C to ensure the system remains in a safe state.
- **Key Concepts**: Safe state, resource allocation, deadlock prevention.

### 9. **Basic Shell Commands and Scripts**
- **Objective**: To recreate basic Linux shell commands in C and develop shell scripts for task automation.
- **Summary**: Built basic command replicas (`ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`) in C and scripted tasks such as condition checks and directory management.
- **Key Concepts**: Bash scripting, file system navigation.

### 10. **Conditional Statements in Shell Scripts**
- **Objective**: To demonstrate conditional logic using `if-else` in shell scripts.
- **Summary**: Scripted logic to determine whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Key Concepts**: User input handling, control structures.

## Learning Outcomes  
These practicals helped me understand:
- The functioning of OS components like the scheduler and memory manager.
- The role of scheduling algorithms in process execution.
- Techniques to prevent and manage deadlocks.
- Shell scripting for automation and system operations.
- Basic system-level programming using C and bash.

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: C  
- **Scripting**: Bash  
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu)  
- **Compiler**: GCC

## Conclusion  
This lab series significantly deepened my understanding of operating system fundamentals through hands-on programming. It fostered critical thinking in resource management and system-level programming, laying the groundwork for future explorations in systems software.
